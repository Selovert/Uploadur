After you take the screenshot, the Uploadur icon (![Uploadur Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selovert/Uploadur/master/Resources/uploadur.png)) should become green ![Uploadur-dl Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selovert/Uploadur/master/Resources/uploadur-dl.png)), followed by a notification that the screenshot has been uploaded.
