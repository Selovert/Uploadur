Using Uploadur is as simple as taking a screenshot in OSX.

After you take the screenshot, the Uploadur icon ![Uploadur Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selovert/Uploadur/master/Uploadur/Images.xcassets/icon.imageset/uploadur.png) should become green ![Uploadur-dl Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selovert/Uploadur/master/Resources/uploadur-dl.png), followed by a notification that the screenshot has been uploaded.
